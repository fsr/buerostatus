:bulb:Helloooo, anybody home?

You know how you always sit at home wondering if anybody is physically @ iFSR. This project aims to solve that issue! Powered by artisinally craftedâ„¢ PHP, Arduinos **and** Raspberry Pi's, this project saves data on when the light is turned on in the faculty.

`.ino` files run on the Arduino, `.py` on the Raspi and `.php` on the server. That's about it :sparkles:
